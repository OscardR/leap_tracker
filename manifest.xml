		LEAP Controller tracking server. This code provides a tracking server for a LEAP Controller
		interface. It constantly listens to the controller for new frames and process the
		hands and fingers data to consistently track individual fingers. It then builds
		ROS JointState, TwistStamped and PoseStamped messages with the values of the hand's
		DOF and sends them through the topic "leap_tracker" for whichever translation service
		listening to that topic to convert them and adapt them to other robot models.
